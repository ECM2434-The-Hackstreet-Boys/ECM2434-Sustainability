                        on campus, and discover the biodiversity we have here. Every question answered builds
                        awareness and highlights the importance of small, everyday choices in contributing to
                        a healthier planet.

                    <p>Our location-based quiz game challenges you to visit sustainability hotspots around
                        campus, answer eco-themed questions, and earn points to buy flowers for you garden!
                        Another way of obtaining points is by tracking your recycling habits by scanning
                        the QR codes on bins around campus. The more you explore , recycle and learn, the
                        more vibrant your garden becomes!
